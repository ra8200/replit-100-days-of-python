# 100 Days of Python

Welcome to my 100 Days of Python challenge! In this repository, I've committed to coding every day for 100 days, exploring various aspects of Python programming. From the basics to more advanced topics, this journey covers a wide array of Python concepts and projects.

## Project Structure

Each day's work is organized into its own folder within the main directory, making it easy to navigate through different topics and projects. Here's how the repository is structured:

100-Days-of-Python/

```100-Days-of-Python/
│
├── Day-01/ (e.g., Python Basics)
├── Day-02/ (e.g., Data Structures)
├── Day-03/ (e.g., Control Flow)
│ ...
└── Day-100/ (e.g., Final Project)
```

## Progress

- [x] Day 1: Python Basics
- [x] Day 2: Data Structures
- [x] Day 3: Control Flow
- [ ] Day 4: ...
- ...
- [ ] Day 100: Final Project

## Highlights

- **Day 1**: Learned the basics of Python syntax, variables, and data types.
- **Day 2**: Explored lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
- **Day 3**: Delved into if-else statements, loops, and flow control.

## Goals and Learning Outcomes

Throughout this 100-day challenge, my goals are to:

- Improve my Python programming skills.
- Understand fundamental and advanced Python concepts.
- Build several mini-projects and one major capstone project.
- Share my learning journey with the community.
